                                one. I thought it will be better as it has dedicated graphic card.The price was 60k when it was launched, 
                                but in sale I got it at 50k. So, I thought it will be a good buy</p>

                            <p>Therse hasn't been any android TV in our home before. Seen in some relatives house, but never used for a long time. During a 
                                big sale, I saw this tv falling down to 13k, where it's original price was 18k. I requested my parents to buy this, as it 
                                has been long time since the old was baught. The main reason for my purchase was that It has a 32inch FHD display, it is 
                                quite rare to find this combination and I know this combiantion will be perfect match in our small sized home.</p>

            <h3>HOW IS THIS ?</h3>
            <p>I purchased this device in 2022. The TV was amazingly good. It has that contrast picture you wish to see for a long time. 
                Altough the sound is kinda low, But in our home we have a old 2.1 hometheatre and with this two mixed, the experience is excellent. 
                Only lack is that, it doesn't has an aux cable and it costed me 1k, to buy the converter from optical to aux. As my hometheatre 
                was old, it has only aux input.</p>
